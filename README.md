# Learning Apache Spark and Integrating Apache Cassandra

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey of learning Apache Spark and integrating it with Apache Cassandra. This repository contains various scripts and examples demonstrating the use of Spark DataFrames, Spark SQL, and Cassandra integration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [PySpark](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/)

### Installation

1. **Install Apache Spark**: Follow the instructions on the [Apache Spark installation page](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html).

2. **Install Apache Cassandra**: Follow the instructions on the [Apache Cassandra installation page](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html).

3. **Install PySpark**: You can install PySpark using pip.
    ```sh
    pip install pyspark
    ```

4. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

## Usage

This repository contains various Python scripts that demonstrate different functionalities of Spark and Cassandra. Below is a basic example of how to create a Spark session, define a schema, and perform some basic operations.
